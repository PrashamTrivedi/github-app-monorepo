Backend scaffolding is building, but we need to make sure dockerfile builds and runs on its own before it can run from the worker.

Current status:
- Fixed wrangler.jsonc container configuration to use proper Cloudflare containers setup
- Updated to use containers as Durable Objects with proper bindings
- Created GitContainer class extending DurableObject<Env> and implementing Container
- Fixed type generation with cf-typegen showing proper DurableObjectNamespace<GitContainer> binding
- Backend dev server recognizes GIT_CONTAINER binding correctly

Next steps needed:
- Test Dockerfile builds independently: `docker build -t git-container ./apps/backend/docker/`
- Verify container runs standalone: `docker run -p 8080:8080 git-container`
- Ensure container exposes the expected API endpoints for git operations
- Test container integration with Worker once dockerfile is validated

The container configuration is now correct according to Cloudflare docs, but we need dockerfile validation before worker integration will work properly.
